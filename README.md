## Notes

The biggest challenge was setting up the Java JDK locally, as in prior projects I had used a very old version of Java, as well as issues with outdated Android Studio code
I needed to add an explicit option into the setup files of Android Studio which was not needed in previous projects.
Ultimately the other challenging part was adapting to github and git CLI token access rather than the old version of username password.
